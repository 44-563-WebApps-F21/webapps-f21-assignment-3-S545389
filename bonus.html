<h3>Red Madame Web</h3>
<p>Red Madame Web was a clairvoyant, and precognitive mutant who first showed up to help Spider-Man find a kidnap victim. She was not one of the mutants that lost their power during the Decimation storyline. She was attacked by Sarah and Ana Kravinoff, who killed her, but not before she was able to pass her powers of precognition as well as her blindness on to Julia Carpenter, who became the next Madame Web. Webb is the grandmother of the fourth Spider-Woman, Charlotte Witter.</p>
