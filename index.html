On average, gondolas are 11 meters long and weigh around 600 kils. In 1608, the Council of Ten approved wearing maks only during the carnival. Those who broke the law were heavily punished.

   <blockquote cite="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/all-pair-shortest-path-floyd-warshall.html">We initialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix as a first step. Then we update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as an intermediate vertex. The idea is to one by one pick all vertices and updates all shortest paths which include the picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in the shortest path. When we pick vertex number k as an intermediate vertex, we already have considered vertices {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as intermediate vertices. For every pair (i, j) of the source and destination vertices respectively, there are two possible cases.For more Info<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyd-warshall-algorithm-dp-16/"> Click Here</a></blockquote>
